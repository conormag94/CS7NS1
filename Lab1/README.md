# Lab 1 - Socket Programming
**This fails at around 94% on the test server because the test server says that the chat server never shuts down (but it does)**

##### Compile:
```
./compile.sh
```
This will build the docker image.

##### Run:
```
./start.sh
```
This will run the server in a docker container called "chat_test" on port 8080.
